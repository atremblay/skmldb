# skmldb
Thin wrapper for a few functions and procedures of MLDB inspired by the interface of scikit-learn. I tried to keep the same kind of logic in modules and naming as in scikit.

This repo has been created as part of my job at Datacratic. 
It is meant for my professional usage and should not be considered as part of the core of MLDB. 
It is not officially supported by Datacratic.
